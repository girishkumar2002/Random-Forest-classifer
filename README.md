Wine and Loan Approval Prediction Analysis
This repository contains a series of analyses and models applied to two datasets: wine quality and loan approval prediction. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification using Decision Trees and Random Forests.

Datasets
Wine Dataset

Source: Wine Quality Dataset
Description: Contains various chemical properties of wine samples with their classification.
Loan Approval Dataset

Source: Loan Approval Prediction Dataset
Description: Contains information about applicants and whether their loan applications were approved or not.
Analysis and Models
1. Wine Dataset Analysis
Data Overview:

The dataset includes features such as alcohol content, malic acid, ash, and others, with the target variable being wine quality.
Decision Tree Classification:

A Decision Tree Classifier was used to predict the wine quality.
Model performance was evaluated on training and test datasets.
The model was visualized to understand the decision-making process.
Gini Index Calculation:

Calculated Gini Index and Information Gain at different nodes of the decision tree.
2. Loan Approval Prediction
Data Preprocessing:

Missing values were handled by imputing with mode (for categorical columns) or median (for numerical columns).
Categorical features were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
Feature Scaling:

Min-Max Scaler was applied to normalize the feature values.
Decision Tree Classification:

A Decision Tree Classifier was trained to predict loan approval.
Model performance was assessed using accuracy on both training and test datasets.
Cross-validation was used to evaluate model stability.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Grid Search CV was performed to find the best hyperparameters for the Decision Tree model.
Random Forest Classification:

A Random Forest Classifier was used to enhance prediction accuracy.
The impact of different tree depths on model performance was evaluated.
Code and Visualization
Decision Tree Visualization:

Visualizations of Decision Trees to understand the model's decision-making process.
Model Accuracy Visualization:

Plots showing the accuracy of different models on training and test datasets.
